# NYC Civilian Complaint Review Board Record Analysis

Completed in collaboration with John Driscoll @jjdrisco.

This project first explores whether allegations of NYPD misconduct are more severe in cases in which the misconduct is against a man than for a woman.
It then presents a model to predict complaint response times (time between complaint being received and closed).
